  <div class="article-container">

    <div class="article-style">
      <p>I was failing. I had worked my ass off. But somehow, I did not see any success.</p>
<p>It was not that I wasn&rsquo;t reaching anyone. I got meetings with interested potential clients. But after having had numerous pitches, I did not see any results.</p>
<p>I got rejected. Often. I heard all the excuses.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sorry, we don&rsquo;t have have any budget right now. Let&rsquo;s talk in half a year.</li>
<li>I talked with the relevant division. They don&rsquo;t have time to organize something.</li>
<li>Your proposal sounds interesting. I&rsquo;ll forward you to another part of the company where you&rsquo;ll fit better.</li>
</ul>
<p>And of course, I never heard back from the company.</p>
<p>At that time, I decided to work harder. To approach more clients. To get more meetings. Somewhere I had heard that hard work would ultimately pay off as a sales guy. Success was waiting for me.</p>
<p>But of course, nothing changed. The system that I had built was running, but not in my favor.</p>
<p>One day I met with one of the founders for lunch. All of a sudden, he said to me, &ldquo;Jonathan, it&rsquo;s not working, right?&rdquo;. I responded, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m doing everything I can, but I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going on&rdquo;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What he then told me was one of the best advice I&rsquo;d ever been given.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Jonathan, I can&rsquo;t help you. But I bet there is someone who can help you. Why don&rsquo;t you ask Justin? He is one of the best sales guys I know&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I was on fire. Justin, yeah, I knew this guy. Startup founder. Cool guy, approachable, and lots of experience.</p>
<p>Overly motivated as I was, I not only reached out to him but also his sales head. One thing led to another, and I had two meetings scheduled.</p>
<p>What happened? We talked a lot about my sales process. About every little detail that I had never thought of. After meeting both of them for 30 minutes each, I was able to point out the mistakes I had made. Not just the mistakes, but also the things I was not doing.</p>
<p>What happened then? I still put in the hard work. But this time, everything changed. Instead of zero offers, I had three on the table. Since we only had one spot open, I had to cancel two potential partners.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When looking back, these mistakes seem so obvious. But little did I know back then.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I had not asked anyone for advice when I started my new role. Everyone seemed to be determined that I was the very best candidate for this role. Therefore, it never crossed my mind to ask for help.</p>
<p>Also, when I was not successful, I did not question my approach. I mean, I was approaching clients and meeting with them. It was just bad luck that I did not get the response that I wanted.</p>
<p>It took someone else to open my eyes. And when my eyes were open, I was able to seek the advice I needed. And when I sought the direction I needed, my actions changed for good.</p>
<h2 id="this-is-how-i-seek-advice">This is how I seek advice.</h2>
<p>I just ask for it. When I have a problem that Google cannot solve, I think about who I can ask. Do I know anyone who could get me going in the right direction? If not, do I have a friend that knows a lot of people in this particular field?</p>
<p>When I have identified someone that can genuinely help me, I sent a message. Straightforward. Where? Most often, they are acquaintances, so I either have their phone number, or I am connected on LinkedIn with them.</p>
<p>I state my problem. What is important here is that I am specific about my problem. That I cannot solve it by myself. Also, I show respect by asking this particular person for advice. I trust this person to be able to help me.</p>
<p>What I ask for is a phone call. Most often, they are glad to help. I mean, who doesn&rsquo;t like to help someone who is actively seeking one&rsquo;s advice? Someone who shows respect and trust?</p>
<p>I know it takes courage to ask an acquaintance or even a stranger for help. But ultimately, their input can help me to solve problems that I could not have solved by myself.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;ve learned through this experience is that hard work is not always the solution. That I&rsquo;m not an expert just because my job description says so. Therefore, I am allowed to get advice. And this advice can help me to get to the very next level.</p>
