      <title>Ideology Classification of U.S. News through Sentiment</title>

      <guid>/post/ideology-classification-of-u.s.-news-through-sentiment/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article was first published on 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/towards-artificial-intelligence/ideology-classification-of-u-s-news-through-sentiment-37d911f31f8c&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Medium&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to determine if news providers’ ideology can be objectively classified by performing some common natural language processing tasks on news articles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But let’s start from the beginning…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Political division is a vital problem in the U.S. Nowadays, even what we eat, what we drive, and how we live is associated with either being Democrat or Republican. Decisions like 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-53477121&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;wearing or not wearing a mask&lt;/a&gt; become part of political identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This political division’s foundation was laid when people with college degrees moved to the cities, and less-educated people stayed in rural areas in the 1970s. Jobs, technologies, and industries followed accordingly, and the cultural differences between Democrats and Republicans were amplified with the emergence of partisan media and social media networks [1].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you think about it: People are exposed to different kinds of information. What people read and what people hear plays a vital role in how they see the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if people are exposed to a news provider that is considered as “far-right” and “ideologically driven,” for example, Breitbart News [2], the world view of this news provider could have a notable influence on their reader’s world view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would I recognize the political ideology of a news provider by just reading some of their articles? And how about other people? Imagine reading “far-right” articles and thinking that this is considered “normal”…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why I started to think about how I can objectively classify news providers’ ideology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I had the idea that Breitbart News would use, for example, more negative words when reporting about Joe Biden while using more positive comments for Trump than other news outlets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence, articles written about a topic that agrees with a particular ideology would have a positive sentiment, while disagreeing issues would negatively affect sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using data from four news providers and applying sentiment and topic models, I will test if my hypotheses are true. If you’re interested in knowing how I conducted the analysis using Python and R, please look at my 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/JRatschat/US_News&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt;. There you can find everything that you need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;data&#34;&gt;Data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I focused on articles from Breitbart News, Politico, Axios, and FiveThirtyEight for the analysis. Let’s first understand who these news providers are and what they stand for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have already introduced Breitbart News, but I will use their wording this time. They stand for “truthful reporting and the free and open exchange of ideas” because this is “essential to maintaining a robust democracy.” Also, they believe “in the greatness of America.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Axios is a news provider that oughts to “deliver the clearest, smartest, most efficient, and trustworthy experience for audience and advertisers alike.” They claim not to follow any ideology. Also, their style of writing was described as a mix of Twitter and the Economist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Politico’s main topics are politics and policy, and their goal is to become the dominant news source on these topics. The stand for “access to reliable information, nonpartisan journalism, and real-time tools” to “create, inform and engage a global citizenry.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last, FiveThirtyEight follows a data-driven coverage of politics and sports and uses common data visualization and statistical analyses to provide a unique news experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to admit: This is a wild mix. Not the typical news providers that you would find in a research paper. So why have I chosen these news providers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I needed some news sources that have a different ideology than Breitbart News. Axios explicitly states that it does not follow any ideology. Therefore, it should be neutral when it comes to ideology. The same goes for Politico that stands for nonpartisan news coverage. For FiveThirtyEight, it’s not as clear. I assumed a more left-leaning position due to their reports in the 2016 election that argued that “Donald Trump isn’t a real candidate” and gave him minimal chances of winning the election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, I would have loved to gather articles from more well-known left-leaning news providers like the New York Times or Washington Post. Sadly, the providers that I had a look at often had websites based on Javascript (instead of HTML), making it harder to extract information with the approach that I used. Also, many news providers have a paywall making it impossible to extract articles without paying for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After I had decided which news providers I wanted to analyze, I gathered articles on the political segments of these news providers. Also, I only extracted pieces from 2020 to have a somehow limited amount of topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These decisions led to a data set that consists of approximately 32.5k articles. Breitbart News contributes around 20k articles to the data set, while I only extracted around 500 items from FiveThirtyEight. Also, there are roughly 7.8k articles from Politico and 3.7k from Axios. Therefore, the findings for Axios, Breitbart News, and Politico should be more robust than the results for FiveThirtyEight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found it interesting to explore some of the differences between the news providers. You can see in the plot below that Axios publishes the shortest articles (it’s no surprise that they are compared to Twitter), closely followed by Breitbart News. Politico and FiveThirtyEight tend to have longer articles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;./plot1.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;sentiment&#34;&gt;Sentiment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I had extracted the data that I needed, it was time to calculate every article’s sentiment. I decided to use the well-established VADER model [3], which is predominantly used for social media postings. However, it was also tested with New York Times Editorials and achieved the best F1 score compared to other sentiment analysis lexicons. Hence, it can also be applied to other areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The model uses a generalizable sentiment lexicon. The list was inspired by the renowned word-banks LIWC, ANEW, and G.I., but the researchers also included emoticons and slang into the dictionary. Interestingly, it not only relies on a fixed sentiment score for each word but also incorporates grammatical and syntactic cues. To take some examples from their paper:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Booster words: “The service here is extremely good” has a stronger positive sentiment than “The service is good.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrastive conjunction: “The food here is great, but the service is horrible.” VADER would sense a mixed sentiment with the latter part of the sentence being dominant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shifts in polarity: “The food here isn’t really all that great.” Although this sentence includes the positive word great, VADER can classify the negative sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although VADER was not built with newspaper articles in mind, I finally decided that its theoretical foundation would be a “good-enough” fit for my analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, VADER becomes handy when working with more massive data sets because it is computationally cheap and does not require training data. Although other algorithms like Google’s BERT could have led to more accurate results, I still remembered the endless computing times that I had with another project, and I was not willing to go through this again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When plotting the mean sentiment of the articles by week, two striking insights became apparent to me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are differences in the sentiment scores between the news providers. FiveThirtyEight tends to have the most positive articles on average, while Breitbart News has the most negative articles on average compared to the other news providers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The news provider’s sentiment develops alike when looking at it over time. For example, all news providers see a strong negative drop of the sentiment score in week 23 and 24 with a recovery in the following weeks. This finding indicates that some topics or occurrences are classified as more positive or negative by VADER than other issues. For example, a major adverse event could have happened in week 23 because there is such a drop in sentiment scores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;./plot2.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;topics&#34;&gt;Topics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since different events are very likely to affect the news articles’ sentiment, it becomes crucial to classify the items into various topics. If not, the sentiment scores would be influenced by the topics, and ideology classification would not be feasible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is an unsupervised machine learning model that extracts the main topics of a given set of words. It assumes that every document consists of a mix of different topics. By going through the documents, LDA extrapolates which topics could have generated them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used LDA to generate topics and to calculate the topic probabilities for each article. For the analysis, I only stored the subject with the highest topic probability. Ultimately, I ended up with 20 overarching topics for January to August 2020. Instead of looking at every topic in detail (which would be boring for you), let’s look at the most prominent issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see the number of articles per day in the below plot, depending on the topic. Some of the issues seem of relatively low importance, while other topics show a high presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;./plot3.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From first sight, Topic 6, 10, and 18 do look the most interesting. I created word clouds and looked at articles with the highest topic probabilities to better understand these topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By looking at the word cloud for Topic 6 and the articles with the highest topic contributions, it is relatively sure that these articles are about the Democratic presidential candidates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;./plot4.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt; Topic 6
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Topic Contribution: 100%
&amp;quot;Why Bernie Sanders Lost&amp;quot; (FiveThirtyEight)

Topic Contribution: 99%
&amp;quot;Electile Dysfunction: Joe Biden Pulls Out Early from New Hampshire&amp;quot; (Breitbart News)

Topic Contribution: 99%
&amp;quot;Joe Biden says Iowa caucus results were a &amp;quot;gut punch&amp;quot;&amp;quot; (Axios)  
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This overarching topic also makes sense when having a look at article count over time. Until March, this topic was of high interest to news providers and the public. Then the interest decreased after Buttigieg, Bloomberg, and Warren dropped out of the Democratic race. Interest increased shortly when Sanders suspended his campaign on April 8 and stayed low until Biden officially won the nomination on August 18.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how about Topic 10?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;./plot5.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt; Topic 10
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You guessed right: Topic 10 mostly consists of articles related to the coronavirus. The word cloud and the article count per day makes sense. I additionally checked the articles with the highest topic contributions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Topic Contribution: 99%
&amp;quot;China Has Not Accepted U.S. Offers to Send CDC Experts to Aid in Coronavirus Fight&amp;quot; (Breitbart News)

Topic Contribution: 99%
&amp;quot;How many Americans have been tested for coronavirus?&amp;quot; (Politico)

Topic Contribution: 99%
&amp;quot;Azar: Coronavirus &#39;a fast-moving, constantly changing situation&amp;quot; (Politico)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Topic 18 seemed relatively easy to spot when only looking at the word cloud and the time trend. For me, it was screaming “Black Lives Matter”!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;./plot6.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt; Topic 18
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when I was assessing the articles with the highest topic contributions, I was confused first. Generally, LDA gave news articles with police operations the highest topic contributions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Topic Contribution: 99%
&amp;quot;Armed Homeowner Kills One Alleged Intruder, Wounds Second&amp;quot; (Breitbart News)

Topic Contribution: 97%
&amp;quot;Pennsylvania Homeowner Shoots Alleged Intruder Dead&amp;quot; (Breitbart News)

Topic Contribution: 96%
&amp;quot;Watch: Daytona Beach Police Shoot Alleged Armed Carjacker&amp;quot; (Breitbart News)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this would have not explained why there was this upheaval in articles during the riots. When looking at articles with lower topic contribution scores, the articles that I had expected appeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Topic Contribution: 90%
&amp;quot;Philadelphia Cops Injured with Chemical Burns During Violent Protests&amp;quot; (Breitbart News)

Topic Contribution: 90%
Title: &amp;quot;Protesters Set NYPD Cars Ablaze in Union Square&amp;quot; (Breitbart News)

Topic Contribution: 88%
Title: &amp;quot;Police Cars in LA, Chicago Damaged and Destroyed by Protesters&amp;quot; (Breitbart News)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This topic intrigued me. Most articles of Breitbart concerning this topic were in favor of the police. When I was looking at reports from Axios, this view diametrically changed to more centered items on what had happened to protesters. This is a significant difference in ideology, but it’s questionable if this difference can be tracked by news sentiment because both points of view should be rather harmful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;multiple-linear-regression&#34;&gt;Multiple Linear Regression&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After I generated variables for both sentiment and topic analyses, I was finally able to conduct a regression estimation. First, I ran a multiple linear regression to see how the topics and news providers (independent variables) are related to the news article’s sentiment (dependent variable). I used robust standard errors since the errors are heteroskedastic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sentimentᵢ = β₀ + β₁⨯Dominant_Topicᵢ + β₂⨯NewsProviderᵢ + 𝜀ᵢ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script src=&#34;https://gist.github.com/JRatschat/8d3a7fc5bc883ee0ab565832018d6b88.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Axios together with Topic 0 is the base case and hidden in the intercept’s coefficient.
Topic 5 (e.g., &lt;em&gt;attack, terrorist, hong kong, iran&lt;/em&gt;) and 18 (e.g., &lt;em&gt;police, riots, black&lt;/em&gt;) is associated with more negative sentiment while topic 6 (e.g., &lt;em&gt;biden, democrat, campaign&lt;/em&gt;) is associated with a more positive effect on sentiment. Also, Politico and FiveThirtyEight tend to report more positively than Axios (as indicated in the intercept) and Breitbart News.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we have to be careful here because the p-value of Breitbart News is nowhere near the commonly used significance levels. Therefore, we can’t reject the Null hypothesis that there is no difference in conditional means between Breitbart News and its articles’ sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although this regression enables some first insights, it is not enough to understand the underlying ideology of a news provider. Remember: I hypothesized that news providers would have differing sentiments about different topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;multiple-linear-regression-with-interaction-effects&#34;&gt;Multiple Linear Regression with Interaction Effects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, I decided to conduct a multiple linear regression with interaction effects. By using interaction effects, it is now feasible to analyze the combined effects of the dominant topics and news providers. Also, I still used robust standard errors in the estimation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://gist.github.com/JRatschat/7c3548b8d130e3d399d7fa51edcc479c&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Sentimentᵢ = β₀ + β₁⨯Dominant_Topicᵢ + β₂⨯NewsProviderᵢ + β₃⨯(Dominant_Topicᵢ⨯NewsProviderᵢ) + 𝜀 &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the p-values of the topics and also Breitbart News and Politico are not near the commonly used significance levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, in the plot below you can see the predicted sentiment per topic and news provider. When searching for differences in sentiment and checking the p-values for each interaction effect in the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://gist.github.com/JRatschat/7c3548b8d130e3d399d7fa51edcc479c&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;regression table&lt;/a&gt;, only Topic 6 seems interesting. Remember: this topic is predominantly about the Democratic presidential candidates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;./plot7.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;**Predicted Sentiment per News Provider for Topic 6**
Axios: 0.54
Breitbart News: 0.44
FiveThirtyEight: 0.75
Politico: 0.66
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breitbart did indeed have the articles with the lowest sentiment. When taking a close look at the interaction terms for Topic 6, it becomes apparent that the coefficient of Breitbart News is the only one with a negative association.
Still, I have to admit that I was somehow disappointed. Only one out of 20 topics showed a result that somehow followed my hypothesis. Also, the differences between the predicted sentiment scores seemed not as high as I would have expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;assessment&#34;&gt;Assessment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what did I do? And how did it go? What did I learn?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I gathered data from four different news providers. Pretty amazing what one can do with a web crawler like scrapy. I was incredibly happy that I was able to gather the articles from the news provider’s websites. A downer was, however, that I could not scrape articles from the New York Times or the Washington Post. These news providers would have better reflected the Democratic element for my analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, calculating the sentiment with the VADER module and looking at it over time led to interesting insights. I was able to spot that the news provider’s sentiment develops alike over time. This finding led me to the hypothesis that topics or occurrences are inherently either positive or negative. Big up- or downswings can happen when major events occur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, classifying news articles into topics using LDA went smoothly. I was impressed by how topics like the “Democratic presidential nomination” or the “Coronavirus” were accurately classified and how much sense the article count over time made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exploring the topics led to realizing the first notable difference between Breitbart News and the other news providers: One can influence an event’s perspective. Breitbart News focused predominantly on what did happen to police officers during protests and riots while the others focused more on the protesters. This difference alone is a strong indicator of a news provider’s ideology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, conducting the regression estimations presented answers to some of the hypotheses that I had made. Yes, sentiment scores are very different, depending on the topic. Also, the estimation did shed light on the general tendency of a news provider’s sentiment. But this alone was of no help in classifying a news provider’s ideology. Only the interaction effects of Topic 6 were promising, but sadly this topic was the only one where my hypothesis somehow made sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I think that my approach to classifying ideology by comparing sentiment scores failed. I still like the idea, but it seems that topics that are perceived as positive or negative depending on the political view are relatively rare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I found one very interesting insight during the topic analysis: News providers reported quite differently about the Black Lives Matters protests. Sadly (for my analysis), the sentiment was not affected by this difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, I have done some groundwork for further investigations. If I have some more time and you are interested in it, I could imagine myself going back to the Black Lives Matter topic. Finding some methods that can objectively show the differences that I indicated would be awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article was first published on 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://towardsdatascience.com/what-pete-buttigieg-has-to-say-about-data-driven-decision-making-23139dd9d26a&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Medium&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pete Buttigieg, former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, gained US-wide popularity when running as a presidential candidate for the 2020 election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was able to secure robust fund-raising and achieved surprisingly good results in the states of Iowa and New Hampshire. After not being able to hold up his momentum, he dropped out of the Democratic race. Still, I was intrigued after first hearing about his story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being born in the Rust Belt, he earned degrees from Harvard and Oxford, worked as a consultant for McKinsey, served in the Afghanistan War, and became mayor of South Bend at the age of 29. Although facing controversies during his two terms as a mayor, he has convinced residents and stakeholders that his hometown is more than just a former manufacturing location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I picked up his book 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.de/Shortest-Way-Home-challenge-Americas/dp/1529398053/ref=sr_1_1?__mk_de_DE=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&amp;amp;crid=8UJLRTX23372&amp;amp;dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=shortest&amp;#43;way&amp;#43;home&amp;amp;qid=1596893365&amp;amp;sprefix=shortest&amp;#43;way&amp;#43;home%2Caps%2C209&amp;amp;sr=8-1&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Shortest Way Home&lt;/a&gt; and was surprised to find out that he is a firm believer in data-driven decision making. Instead of making decisions based on gut-feeling, he argues that analytical analysis helps the city become more efficient and fact-driven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming from consulting, he first assumed that more data and analytics would always be beneficial for his administration. But soon, he realized that many resources could be wasted due to data generated either not being used or only giving information that is already known.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He had to make sure that data was not only generated but that it also served a purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pete Buttigieg has come up with six crucial learnings from his terms as a mayor that I want to share with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-there-is-a-difference-between-reporting-and-solving-an-issue&#34;&gt;1. There is a difference between reporting and solving an issue.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes reporting and solving an issue can go hand in hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, Pete Buttigieg’s administration installed ShotSpotter technology that uses microphones to spot gunshots in the whole city. On the one hand, the administration got reliable data on where shots were fired. This was essential because some neighborhoods did not call the police when gunshots were fired. On the other hand, police officers could get much faster to cases of gun violence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But often, knowing more about the problem does not help in solving it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, the former mayor attended a conference in which a startup introduced a product that could automatically detect opioids’ patterns in sewage. The administration was well aware of the problem of opioid usage in South Bend but lacked funds to take care of the mental health and addiction resources. In acquiring the opioid detecting product, the administration would have gathered more data on this problem. But it would also have taken away valuable resources from initiatives solving this issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, he argues in his book that when one is already aware of a problem and has the means to fix it, one should focus on resolving the issue. This does not mean that reporting an issue is unnecessary, but it is also not sufficient to solve the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;2-there-is-a-difference-between-responsiveness-and-efficiency&#34;&gt;2. There is a difference between responsiveness and efficiency.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During Pete Buttigieg’s term as a mayor, he had to decide various times between being responsive or efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of snowplowing, he could have decided that the snowplowing crews had always been driven to the streets first for whom residents called in. This would have made these streets residents indeed very happy, but this had not been an efficient approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why? Because these crews would zigzag through the city. By using a zone-based approach, snowplow crews can take care of all streets much faster. But this means that not every impassable road is directly taken care of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At other times, Pete Buttigieg argues that being responsive is the most efficient thing. For instance, graffiti should be taken care of as soon as it is reported because other people could be motivated to imitate or surpass this graffiti. Also, if it is directly taken care of, graffiti sprayers are discouraged from defacing public property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;3-be-honest-whether-you-are-willing-to-follow-the-data-where-it-leads&#34;&gt;3. Be honest whether you are willing to follow the data where it leads.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this learning, the former mayor had to decide on how he could keep waste bill rates under control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He asked one of his public work directors for help. He got presented various ideas: selling ad space on trash bins, charging customers based on the amount of waste, or introducing automated trash trucks that use a robotic arm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The automated trash trucks were the best solution, partly eliminating human garbage collectors and reducing injury rates. The data was clear that this new technology would lead to lower waste bill rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a tough decision. Replacing humans with machines often means that some people will lose their jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He decided to go forward with this proposal, and half of the workers laid off were able to switch jobs to other employments offered by the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At other times, Pete Buttigieg was not ready to follow the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Offices, where people can go to pay their water bills, seem to be of another time. People can pay online, by phone or email. So why is it still necessary to have this costly infrastructure? Because especially residents with low income do not have bank accounts. They need a place where they can pay in cash even if it is costly for the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, one could follow the data on this case, but this would mean severe harm to these low-income residents. So are you really willing to follow the data where it leads?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;4-data-can-show-you-answers-to-questions-you-never-even-asked&#34;&gt;4. Data can show you answers to questions you never even asked.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, searching for an answer can lead to an answer to another question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember the example with the gunshot technology? Gathering this data and getting faster help for gunshot cases helped in answering another crucial question. To which extent do neighborhoods trust the police? The fewer neighbors called (if any), the lower would be the perceived police legitimacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, this enabled officers to show up even if nobody bothered to call. Neighbors were expecting that the police would not care about gunshots in their area. By coming to these neighborhoods, the police were able to increase trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, it can be helpful to ask yourself the question: “Is there another issue that I can solve with the data?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;5-confusion-between-technical-and-moral-questions&#34;&gt;5. Confusion between technical and moral questions.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Answering technical questions seem so easy because often they are right or wrong questions. But when it comes to moral issues, it is often impossible to make someone better off without making another one worse off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the city decided to get these new automatic trash trucks. Although this decreased waste bills rates, it led to layoffs. Instead of keeping the trash bins in the alleys, residents were now pressured to haul their trash bins to the front curb. Of course, the workers and residents were not happy with this change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What Pete Buttigieg stated for this decision is that there was no mathematical formula to solve this trade-off. Therefore, they had to make the decision and explain to those affected why they took this decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;6-exceptions-are-important&#34;&gt;6. Exceptions are important.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data-driven decision making is centered around rules. And if a rule is not sufficient, a sub-rule can be implemented. But sometimes that is not enough. Instead of following the rules, a better direction is to make an exception even though one cannot explain or defend this exception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, for example, an older man called the city to ask for help with a dead raccoon. Following the rule book would have had a clear answer: The city has no obligation to help the man because the raccoon is on the man&amp;rsquo;s private yard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But obviously, the man was calling because he could not help himself. Instead of following the rule book, a council member drove to the man’s house, dragged the raccoon onto the street, and made sure that the case was handled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Pete Buttigieg is a believer in data-driven decision making. He believes that it can enable people to make smarter and fairer decisions. And yet he is well aware that data has limitations and that not every problem can be solved by it. Also, he is determined that there are decisions in which one must follow his or her intuitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed reading his book for several reasons. Although I was excited about his chapter on data-driven decisions (Chapter 11-Subconscious Operations), I also learned much more about American politics and the Rust Belt’s struggles.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to Increase the Interpretability of Your Predictive Model</title>
      <link>/post/how-to-increase-the-interpretability-of-your-predictive-model/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 12 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/post/how-to-increase-the-interpretability-of-your-predictive-model/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article was first published on 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-increase-the-interpretability-of-your-predictive-model-b786d72365f1&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Medium&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accuracy and interpretability are said to be diametrically different. Complex models tend to achieve the highest accuracies, while simpler models tend to be more interpretable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what if we want to get the best of both worlds? Getting a high accuracy is cool, but wouldn’t it be great if we can understand the model? Especially, if the prediction is essential to the success of a business? As Ribeiro et al. state:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“[…] if the users do not trust a model or a prediction, they will not use it.” (Ribeiro et al. 2016, p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;hypothetical-situation&#34;&gt;Hypothetical Situation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s imagine the following: We work as data scientists at a huge savings bank. Our job is to make sure that we know which customers have a high likelihood to churn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What will happen with our model? We will use our results to create customer groups with differing churn probabilities.
The customer groups with the highest churn probabilities then receive targeted marketing so that they hopefully do not leave the bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retaining customers is associated with much lower costs compared to acquiring new customers (Keaveney 1995). Therefore, our job is crucial for the success of the bank!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We must achieve two goals:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The marketing team must receive the most accurate results possible. Why? Because the bank is spending money to retain these customers. If the customers would have stayed anyway, the bank is throwing money out of the window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must convince relevant stakeholders that they can trust our results. Good luck explaining to the marketing boss how we created our model…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let’s imagine that the marketing boss does not understand our model, but trusts us (for whatever reason). &lt;em&gt;Therefore, they implement our complex model.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This model has high predictive power. The marketing team is happy because they are seeing that the measures conducted help to retain customers. We are so glad because we get positive feedback for the model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nice! We could call it a day and focus our efforts on the next task to even receive more credits for the great work that we do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BUT STOP! HOLD ON!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accuracy and interpretability cannot be achieved with the same model, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, we focused only on the model’s accuracy. But what if the model has flaws?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could have included one variable in our model that has literally no meaning. Somehow, it worked for a while, but then it didn’t, and nobody recognized it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even worse: We could have created a sexist algorithm that causes an uproar on social media. Do you think I’m kidding? This has somehow happened to 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/15/us/apple-card-goldman-sachs.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Apple and Goldman Sachs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would a manager risk his/her career for only a few accuracy points more?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can give you a plain and simple answer here… No, managers won’t take the risk. They have spent many years building their careers, and they don’t know anything about machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, predicting churn probabilities is probably not a hot-topic that will lead to an uproar in the media. But if our model is not working in our favor because we failed to understand it correctly, the consequences can be painful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-solution&#34;&gt;The Solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interpretability is essential because it promotes confidence and trust in our model. Users do not adopt a model that fails to do so. Also, enhanced interpretability can help to improve model performance and extends the knowledge that we can derive from the model (Lundberg &amp;amp; Lee 2017).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nice! By increasing interpretability, we are not only able to understand our model, but we could gain valuable insights. Maybe the marketing team would love to get more ideas about their customers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, eliminating the trade-off between a model’s accuracy and a model’s interpretability has gained attention by researchers (Ribeiro et al. 2016, Lundberg &amp;amp; Lee 2017, Chen et al. 2018).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of their solutions has gained a lot of attention: SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values introduced by Lundberg &amp;amp; Lee (2017).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SHAP values stem from game theory. They measure the marginal effect that the observed level of a variable has on the final predicted probability for an individual (Lundberg et al. 2019).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through this approach, it becomes feasible to explain why a customer receives its churn prediction value and how the features contribute to this prediction. This local interpretability increases transparency. Also, it becomes feasible to combine local explanations to derive global interpretability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s use these mysterious SHAP values to transform a complex model into a complex AND interpretable model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;and-action&#34;&gt;And Action&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, we want to know which customers will churn. Therefore, I use this 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.kaggle.com/barelydedicated/bank-customer-churn-modeling&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Kaggle data set&lt;/a&gt; for predicting churn probabilities of bank customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script src=&#34;https://gist.github.com/JRatschat/10111eb2677af4398ae0d24639140a56.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the prediction, I used a basic logistic regression and a default XGBoost algorithm. To make the post somehow readable, I won’t show lines of code. If you’re interested in knowing how I build the model, please have a look at 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/JRatschat/How-to-Increase-the-Interpretability-of-Your-Predictive-Model&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;my GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt;. There you can find everything that you need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let’s quickly compare model statistics of the logit model and the default XGBoost model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The logit model reaches a test accuracy of 84.1 percent while the default XGBoost model has a test accuracy of 86.6 percent. How about AUC? Here, the logit model has an AUC of 82.3 percent compared to an AUC of 85.1 percent for the default XGBoost model.
Indeed, the more complex model is better in predicting who’s going to churn and who’s going to stay at the bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what we could generally use for XGBoost are three different importance measures through which we can have a more detailed look on our model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;./plot1.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Importance plots of XGBoost model. Plot created by author.
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What comes to my mind? The three importance measures assign different levels of importance to the features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I cannot see the relationship between the independent variables and churn. Does a higher age increase or decrease the probability of being a churner? The plots do not help answer this question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let’s have a look at how our model is interpreted using SHAP values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the figure below, features are ordered by their global impact on the default XGBoost model. Higher SHAP values represent a higher prediction of a customer exiting the bank. The dots represent the feature impact on the model output of individual predictions of the training set. Depending on the feature value, the dots are colored from blue (low) to red (high). Therefore, we can explore the extent, strength, and direction of a feature’s effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;./plot2.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;SHAP summary plot. Plot created by author with [SHAPforxgboost](https://github.com/liuyanguu/SHAPforxgboost).
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The highest global feature importances are taken by Age, NumOfProducts, and IsActiveMember. There are several interesting insights that we can derive from this summary plot:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The range of feature impacts on the forecast is widely distributed. For example, age has a strong effect on the prediction for some customers, while for others, it only has a small effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although some of the variables have low global importance, the feature’s influence can be powerful for some individuals. For example, the credit score has a positive predictive relationship with churn for people with low credit scores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first sight, some variables show an intuitive relation to churn, while for others, it is counterintuitive. For example, why is a higher number of products related to an increase in the churn probability? Does this make sense?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To explore single variables more closely, we can use dependence plots. In the figure below, a SHAP dependence plot for age is displayed. As with the summary plot, each dot is a customer. As shown, younger customers have a lowered predictive value to churn, while older customers have an increased predictive value to churn. But this is not a linear relationship! When reaching the age of 60, customer churn probabilities start to decrease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;./plot3.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;SHAP dependence plot. Plot created by author with [SHAPforxgboost](https://github.com/liuyanguu/SHAPforxgboost).
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good luck exploring this relationship with a logit model…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;./plot4.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Summary output of logistic regression based on the same data as the XGBoost model. Age variable is highlighted.
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get crazy, we can also look at the interaction effects of variables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the left panel below, you can see the same dependence plot for the age variable. But this time, I added the gender variable to see how age and gender interact with each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the right panel, the interaction effect of age and gender is depicted more closely. Somehow (and I am lacking the domain knowledge to interpret this), there is a different behavior of men and women when paired with age. For example, younger women have negative SHAP interaction value meaning that the SHAP value is lower for young women compared to young men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;./plot5.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;SHAP dependence plot (left panel) and SHAP interaction plot (right panel) for age and gender. Plots created by author with [SHAPforxgboost](https://github.com/liuyanguu/SHAPforxgboost).
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, so good. But how about the mentioned effect of the number of products that the customers have on the churn prediction? At least for me, it seems counterintuitive that customers with more products have a higher likelihood of churning. We all know how hard it is to terminate contracts, especially bank contracts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When looking at the coefficient values of the logistic regression, we see the same effect. Somehow, customers that have two products have a lower churn probability compared to customers that have one, three, or four products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;./plot6.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Summary output of logit model based on the same data as the XGBoost model. NumOfProducts2 variable is highlighted.
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, I assume that this trend is present in the data and not randomly used by our XGBoost model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Am I still worried? Yes. What would I usually do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Look at the literature.&lt;/strong&gt; This relationship could make sense, who knows?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question the relevance of the data.&lt;/strong&gt; I already had the topic in mind when I was searching for a data set. I did not have a lot of alternatives, and this data set has no copyrights. The algorithm is only as good as the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Explore the data set.&lt;/strong&gt; An explanatory analysis before building the model is highly advisable. Maybe, I could find some patterns that can explain this counterintuitive result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Delete the variable.&lt;/strong&gt; If I suspected that the variable does not provide meaningful results and could lead to flaws, I would delete it. Even if that would mean losing some accuracy or AUC percentage points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analysis that I have conducted so far could be done for every variable. We need to fully understand our model, right? But since this article has gotten really long (thumps up if you made it so far!), I will spare you further analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is vital that we understand our predictive model and that this model captures the generalized underlying trends of the data. If not, the company faces a ticking time bomb. All could go well until it doesn’t anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, we need to able to explain our results to relevant stakeholders. Explaining predictive models and first foremost SHAP values to someone who has trouble understanding basic statistics is hard! Still, these stakeholders are often the decision-makers, so we must make sure that we can convince them that our model really works in practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides mitigating possible risks by increasing the trust in our model, we can get additional insights that we wouldn’t get with simpler models. This can be highly relevant. Especially for marketing departments who are always interested in understanding their customers.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How 190 Students and I Have Learned Data Science</title>

      <pubDate>Sun, 21 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/post/how-190-students-and-i-have-learned-data-science/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article was first published on 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://towardsdatascience.com/how-190-students-and-i-have-learned-data-science-55da9e0e5c6b&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Medium&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two years ago, I was taking a beginner’s class in R at my university. I had heard of the term data science, but I didn’t even know that this would be my first exposure to this exciting world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I was just taking this class to meet people. The week quickly passed, I learned some of the basics and got interested in programming. But I didn’t know how I should proceed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I did some additional online classes on DataCamp but quickly stopped. Why? Even though the website itself is an excellent starting point, I just did not have goals that would keep me going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My life went on, I had other responsibilities, and coding was not a priority anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward two years. I have conducted several data science projects ranging from prediction to text mining tasks in Python and R. More importantly, my team and I at 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://tech-academy.io/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;TechAcademy&lt;/a&gt; have supported 190 students in their journey to learn to code. Students with different backgrounds and experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to share my perspective with you. It’s a personal assessment of what works best to get results fast. Keep in mind that everyone is different. So if you&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;are just starting to learn to code,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;can’t stand to do another online class or get relatively fast bored with online assignments,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;or wonder which philosophy we used to teach 190 students coding,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;then keep on reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what changed? How could I go from zero to where I am now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the only thing that counts is motivation. I had to make sure that coding became a priority. Up until then, my thoughts around coding were based on extrinsic motivation. This is what was going on in my head:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh yeah, I heard that coding is essential in the 21st century. I will have much better opportunities in the job market if I know how to handle some lines of code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to switch it to a more intrinsically motivated way of thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really like coding. It’s fun to get exciting results with every line of code that I write. It enables me to do really crazy shit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who do you think has more stamina? The oh-I’m-having-better-job-opportunities-guy or the person that really just loves coding for the sake of coding?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But to get to this state, you have to put in the work. You can’t love coding when you have only watched a few tutorials. Coding is not a quick game of Rock Paper Scissors. Coding is more like a long game of Risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the beginning, it’s hard to understand the rules. But once you’re in the flow, every new situation gets easier. This is the point that you want to reach. You want to understand the underlying rules of the programming language of your choice. Afterward, every new project or method is doable and exciting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how can you reach that state? And how can we make sure that you are going to love coding?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;basics&#34;&gt;Basics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Online classes have their place, especially for beginners. They are a perfect starting place for taking on the basics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you’ve never written a line of code, head over to an online learning platform like 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.datacamp.com/?tap_a=5644-dce66f&amp;amp;tap_s=954303-e3524b&amp;amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;amp;utm_source=jonathanratschat&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Datacamp&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;(affiliate link)&lt;/em&gt; or Udemy. There you can start to understand the programming language that you want to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how many online classes should you do? I recommend sticking to the basics. Try to keep it simple. Why? Because after some classes you should have quite a good idea of how this programming language works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could go on and learn everything there is through online classes. I doubt that this is the most efficient and effective way of learning data science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some classes teach you every way possible to load data into R or Python. dta-, csv-, excel-, json-, whatever-files… But do you really need to spend 6 hours of your valuable time to learn this? It’s way more efficient to just google how to load your specific file when you actually have a file that you want to use. This should be sufficient, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, getting an overload of information that I’m not going to use is pointless. It’s a waste of time. Also, I’m just not good at following online classes. I get bored very fast. And this kills my motivation. If you enjoy online courses, then you can, of course, take more classes. But please be intentional about them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;taking-it-to-the-next-level&#34;&gt;Taking it to the next level&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that you have learned the basics, how should you proceed? How can we make sure that you’re staying motivated?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is plain and simple. You have to create something on your own. Take the things that you have learned and create your first personal project. Learning by doing. You need to realize what power you have achieved by just learning the basics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Jonathan, I really don’t know what kind of project I should do. Can you help me out?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, I got your back!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At TechAcademy, we give our students projects in which they get the data and have to perform explanatory analyses. With this simple task, they have to load the data,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script src=&#34;https://gist.github.com/JRatschat/e5acb02f6f513f3ed18589528701efde.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;have a first look on it,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script src=&#34;https://gist.github.com/JRatschat/d6ae820c7abc213715b0453d4ac74c49.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;bring it into the right format (data manipulation),&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script src=&#34;https://gist.github.com/JRatschat/7bd90c17a9d08de2c397e54682d4e50a.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and get first insights by creating plots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script src=&#34;https://gist.github.com/JRatschat/d8876f339d5b4ad97e99ba0ddf92a43e.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;./plot.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Plot based on Lukas Jürgernsmeier’s TechAcademy Solution
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although that’s no rocket science, this is an integral part of being a data scientist. To work with the data, you have to understand the data. This is only a simple example. You could go crazy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why don’t you go on Kaggle right now and load the data from the famous 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Titanic data set&lt;/a&gt;? If you are a beginner, don’t try to predict something right away. Just load the data, look at the structure, and try to find some insights. This helps you to apply your new skills. This is not enough? Go on to the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;tidytuesday repository&lt;/a&gt; on Github and measure your data tidying and visualization skills with the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From there on, you can add to your skillset with every project that you conduct. If explanatory analyses get boring, try to learn what machine learning is. Read some articles about it and get started with predicting the survival variable of the Titanic data set. If you’ve mastered this, how about doing some text mining stuff?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least for me, tackling projects is so much fun. I am using the tools that I learned to explore or predict stuff. How cool is that compared to an online class where you just do what you’re told to?
Additionally, you’re building a portfolio that you could share with your community. This is more exciting than presenting the 1000th certificate of an online class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following step-by-step tutorials with final tests or little projects are okay. But creating a project of your own requires much more thinking and creativity. You really have to understand the underlying data and use it to reach your goals. This is a critical skill of a data scientist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, it’s not always easy. You’re getting errors, and you don’t know why. Every line of code could become a disaster. But it is how it is. Most likely, this error has not only happened to you. Stackoverflow or just any other side is your savior. Just type the error message in Google search, and you’ll be helped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning to code to become a data scientist doesn’t have to be an elusive rabbit that you cannot catch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are manageable and actionable strategies you can employ to reach your goals very quickly with a lot of fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strategies are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-stay-patient-and-let-your-motivation-grow&#34;&gt;1) Stay patient and let your motivation grow.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure you understand why you want to learn to code. Generally, every one of us lives in a digital world that is exponentially changing. Having coding skills (not limited to data science) is a great skill that can help you to reach your goals. But be sure that you find ways to enjoy it. Give it some time. Data science becomes great after you have gathered the necessary skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-generally-only-use-online-classes-in-the-beginning&#34;&gt;2) Generally, only use online classes in the beginning.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Online courses are a great way to learn the basics. But there is no need to learn everything through online classes. Also, they can get boring, at least for me. Make sure that you don’t pressure yourself to complete all the classes of a data science track if you don’t enjoy this kind of learning. Being a data scientist is not defined as someone who is having a certificate laying around somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;3-take-your-skills-to-the-next-level-by-conducting-projects&#34;&gt;3) Take your skills to the next level by conducting projects.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Projects are fun. They enable you to get creative with the skills that you have learned. If you want to learn something new, read some articles and try it out. Take one project at a time, make it harder, and reap the benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting to code is not an easy task. I have seen many people struggle with the first few steps. Once you’ve kept showing up, everything becomes more accessible. I hope that these strategies help you to enjoy coding and especially data science.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to Collect Data for Your Analysis</title>
      <link>/post/how-to-collect-data-for-your-analysis/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 06 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/post/how-to-collect-data-for-your-analysis/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article was first published on 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-collect-data-for-your-analysis-a8bc58043e64&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Medium&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How great would it be when data could be as easily accessed as on Kaggle?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data collection? Just visit Kaggle, find a suitable data set, and download it. How about analyzing the Titanic incident from 1912? Or how about image recognition of flowers? No? Maybe you want to predict credit card fraud detection? Guess what, Kaggle has you covered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you have decided on your data set of interest, the fun can finally start. Taking 5 minutes to find a suitable data set was already stressful enough, right? The most elaborate machine algorithms are waiting for you. So ultimately, who cares about the data?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, the real world is different. Having the right data and data quality are key to making causal statements or to constructing machine learning algorithms that can really have an impact. Without relevant data, your analyses would be fun, but irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, you cannot always find perfectly preprocessed data that fulfill your needs. Also, you need to understand where the data has come from and how it was built. Ultimately, we need to keep in mind what Kaggle is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is most famous for being a place in which one can enter competitions to solve data science challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you want to make a name for yourself as a serious predictive modeler, you have found the perfect website to show off your skills. If you’re going to gather data to write a research paper or to build something that works in the real world, Kaggle could be the wrong source for your data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my experience, data collection and preparation can take days to complete. What I have done so far is to build data sets from scratch and access data sets from government institutions. Both have their limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I want to show you is a practical introduction to how you could create relevant data sets that support you in your research/machine learning goals.
Let’s get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, you have to assess the following two questions to conduct your analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What kind of data do you need?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can you access it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Answering these questions is critical but not always straightforward. Of course, a Google search could lead to results, but asking peers for advice could also be helpful. Spend some time with these questions until you’re sure that you have found the right answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-building-a-data-set-from-scratch&#34;&gt;1. Building a data set from scratch&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one of my projects, I needed to access financial data from German companies to analyze the effect of a new mandatory accounting standard on bid-ask spreads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, my professor supplied us with a Thomson Reuters account, and I could use Datastream to access the financial data of these companies. You would think that simply using this database would be sufficient and that I could finally do the real work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;False! When gathering the data for these companies, I ended up with 8 different excel sheets that I had to somehow merge into one data frame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Datastream provided me with some static company information that would end up as my main sheet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script src=&#34;https://gist.github.com/JRatschat/76a060e7e11a14059ea4b74ffe709c14.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other excel sheets that I got had the following format because I was accessing time-series data for each company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script src=&#34;https://gist.github.com/JRatschat/5192b85df1cd7723597f1a978abbf8bf.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how can I get such data into a meaningful format so that I can use it along with the other company information?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s perform one of my calculations so that you get the idea. I had two sheets — one for bid prices and one for ask prices. What I needed was the average relative bid-ask spread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I loaded the data and controlled for missing values. I spotted one row that was completely missing and deleted it for both data sets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script src=&#34;https://gist.github.com/JRatschat/2370fb9bb52695789bc00109990a5f2c.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I calculated the bid-ask spread by subtracting the bid price from the ask price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script src=&#34;https://gist.github.com/JRatschat/c0fcd949a42ec26f878820dbfdc12dd2.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-&amp;gt;&#34;&gt;&#39;data.frame&#39;: 152 obs. of  50 variables:
$ D.AB1 : num  0.034 0.069 0.038 ...
$ D.AOX : num  0.38 0.36 0.38 ...
$ D.AAD : num  0.38 0.4 0.36 ...
$ D.CAG : num  0.04 0.1 0.04 ...
$ D.B5A : num  0.36 0.395 0.395 ...
$ D.BDT : num  0.37 0.75 1 ...
$ D.BIO3: num  0.84 0.82 0.82 ...
$ D.O2C : num  0.151 0.15 0.15 ...
$ D.CEV : num  0.305 0.295 0.2 ...
$ D.CWC : num  0.535 1.175 1.335 ...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I had to calculate the relative bid-ask spread. Therefore, I had to import the daily stock prices, deleted the 149th row, and calculated the bid-ask spreads relative to the price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script src=&#34;https://gist.github.com/JRatschat/a315f1a9f4d23e484b8b22a3a63005a3.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I calculated the mean of the relative bid-ask spreads and merged it into the static data frame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script src=&#34;https://gist.github.com/JRatschat/077571824c7fc5ccbeba86985aaab480.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-&amp;gt;&#34;&gt;&#39;data.frame&#39;: 50 obs. of  6 variables:
$ MNEM                 : chr  &amp;quot;D.2HRA&amp;quot; &amp;quot;D.AAD&amp;quot; &amp;quot;D.AB1&amp;quot; ...
$ NAME                 : chr  &amp;quot;H &amp;amp; R&amp;quot; &amp;quot;AMADEUS FIRE&amp;quot; ...
$ WC05350              : POSIXct, format: &amp;quot;2011-12-31&amp;quot; ...
$ MV                   : num  644 150 331 638 622 ...
$ NOSHFF               : num  44 74 63 44 52 45 100 ...
$ mean_relative_bid_ask: num  0.0138 0.0139 0.0163 ...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is only the code for one additional variable! Imagine doing that for 20 or even 30 other variables that you cannot get out-of-the-box from Datastream. This takes way longer than 5 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many other feasible methods of how you can create your own data set from scratch. You could, for example, conduct a good old survey or scrape tweets from Twitter. Ultimately, it depends on what kind of data you need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, it’s time for a quick assessment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advantages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Features are included based on the purpose of the research question or task. Not vice versa. This helps to only use meaningful data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is traceable how the variables were created.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disadvantages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It can be challenging to find suitable sources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It takes a lot of time to gather the data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transforming features into the right format can be a lot of effort.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Access to databases like Thomson Reuters is often restricted. If your university or employer does not have a license, this kind of information can get very costly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;2-using-a-data-set-from-a-governmental-institution&#34;&gt;2. Using a data set from a governmental institution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One could think that accessing data from governmental institutions is as easy as obtaining data from Kaggle. Wrong! Often, you have to put in a lot of time to understand the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for another project, I wanted to research the effect of financial literacy on stock market participation. For assessing this research question, I found quite a lot of research papers that made use of the Survey of Consumer Finances to analyze stock market participation. Therefore, I accessed the newest version (2016) of this cross-sectional survey of US families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Little did I know how difficult understanding and working with this data set would be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the SEC has published all relevant data here. I spend a substantial time finding the right data set. First, I tried out the R-implementation, but in the end, I found it too difficult to use. Then, I accidentally downloaded the summary extract and wondered why the data was so different than described in the codebook. After a long journey of losing my mind, I found the complete data that I would be using for my analyses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When looking at the data, I found that all variables were encoded. I had to use this codebook to make sense of the data. For every single variable…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script src=&#34;https://gist.github.com/JRatschat/611f83af96c0a0cddfa3d30eb3176669.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The codebook is really really long. Even the SEC notes on the first lines of the codebook the crazy size of this document. It contains about 45,000 lines of text. They recommend to not print the entire document. Great advice…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;./SEC.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;First lines of the SCF’s Codebook.
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spend many hours finding the questions that I could use to create meaningful variables. Ever used the search tool in Chrome? I probably used it 10,000 times for finding the right variables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, the summary extract that I first downloaded proofed to be helpful. Instead of calculating the numerous financial information of the households in R, I just merged this data set to the complete survey data set. Funny story: The calculations are specified in a SAS script. I attempted to translate it into R. After wasting two hours, I remembered the summary extract…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I had a data set that I could start to analyze. But of course, I had many more problems with it. Have you ever heard of weighting and multiple imputations? These topics are difficult and painful, at least for me. But this is another story to tell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the SCF is only one of the numerous available governmental data sets. And besides governmental data, there are also data sets from organizations like the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://data.worldbank.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;World Bank&lt;/a&gt;, 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.who.int/gho/database/en/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;WHO&lt;/a&gt;, or 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.iatiregistry.org/publisher/unicef&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Unicef&lt;/a&gt;. Some might be much easier to handle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, a quick assessment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advantages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Commonly high data quality. Especially if the data has been used by other researchers or practitioners.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Often data is well documented. Therefore, one can understand how the variables were created.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disadvantages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It can take a lot of time to gather and transform features (think about the 45,000 lines of text).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It can be hard to understand the data sets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Access is sometimes only given on a request basis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what have we learned? Accessing data can be quite a hassle and takes time. Loading data and being ready to rumble? No, this is unrealistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what collecting data the old way (not on Kaggle) ultimately does is that we must ask ourselves the right questions. We have to think before we have the data. Why? Because collecting data is a lot of effort. This means that we hopefully collect and use meaningful data for our analyses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that an analysis can only be as good as the quality of the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <guid>/post/getting-to-a-hyperparameter-tuned-xgboost-model-in-no-time/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article was first published on 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://towardsdatascience.com/getting-to-an-hyperparameter-tuned-xgboost-model-in-no-time-a9560f8eb54b&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Medium&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s face it. You&amp;rsquo;re an aspiring Data Scientist. You need to desperately solve a classification task either to impress your professor or to finally become one of these mysterious Kaggle winners. The problem is that you&amp;rsquo;ve got no time. The presentation or the Kaggle competition is due in 24 hours. Of course, you could stick to a simple logit regression and call it a day. &amp;ldquo;No, not this time!&amp;rdquo; you think, and you&amp;rsquo;re browsing the web to find THE SOLUTION. But it better be fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, this is a highly improbable event. However, I wanted to share an easy XGBoost implementation that proved to be lightning-fast (compared to other solutions) that can help you to achieve a more stable and accurate model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hyperparameter-tuning was the step in which I lost most of my &amp;ldquo;valuable&amp;rdquo; time. I had to choose between different options ranging from manually trying out different hyperparameter combinations to more advanced methods like grid or random search. I felt overwhelmed. Ultimately, it took quite a while to find a technique that fulfilled my needs. Therefore, the focus will be on this step of building an XGBoost model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why are we using XGBoost again? Because it rocks. It is an optimized distributed gradient boosting library that has been used with great success on many machine learning challenges. Among the advantages of XGBoost are that its models are easily scalable, tend to avoid overfitting, and can be used for a wide range of problems [1].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, only preparing the data and executing XGBoost would somehow work. But clearly, there is no free lunch in data science. This procedure would leave you with a model that is most likely overfitted and therefore performs badly on an out-of-sample data set. Meaning: you have created a useless model that you should not use with other data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, XGBoost offers several ways to make sure that the performance of the model is optimized. Hyperparameter-tuning is the last part of the model building and can increase your model&amp;rsquo;s performance. Tuning is a systematic and automated process of varying parameters to find the &amp;ldquo;best&amp;rdquo; model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, learning is best done through a reproducible example, so please feel free to copy the code and run it in RStudio (or any other IDE) if you are experiencing any troubles with my explanations. I assume a basic understanding of machine learning, so please use Google if anything is not clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first part, I build (together with you) a basic XGBoost model. Thus, we are loading, preparing, and transforming the data, and at the end of this section, we will have received our first results. In the second part, I discuss my experiences with several hyperparameter-tuning methods. For our final model, we will use a random search algorithm to increase the predictive accuracy of our binary classification task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;building-an-xgboost-model-with-mostly-default-parameters&#34;&gt;Building an XGBoost model with (mostly) default parameters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chose to use the famous Titanic data set from Kaggle. If you have a Kaggle account, you can get the data here. If you don&amp;rsquo;t have a Kaggle account, you can also check out my GitHub repository, where you&amp;rsquo;ll find the data sets and the scripts of this blog post. As an aspiring data scientist, you most likely have at least one of these accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our task is to predict whether a passenger survived the tragic titanic incident or not - a typical binary classification task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we load the necessary packages and train.csv and test.csv. Then we can have a look at the structure of the data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After getting an overview, we need to perform data preparation and feature engineering tasks. I just used some common sense and looked for some examples on Kaggle. Feature engineering is not the focus of this post. Therefore, I stick to the basics. But be aware that feature engineering is generally a crucial step and can significantly enhance the performance of your model. If you are not writing a blog post about hyperparameter-tuning, then spend much more time on this step! If you need individual guidance with excellent explanations, have a look here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To perform these tasks, we bind the rows of the train and test set into one data frame. XGBoost needs to be able to work with the data. Therefore, we need to one-hot encode the data sets into sparse matrices. This is done because XGBoost only works with numeric or integer variables. Since we have factor variables in our data sets, the following approach creates one column per feature level. So instead of one row for Pclass, we will obtain the rows Pclass1, Pclass2, and Pclass3. This is also the reason why I put train and test set into one data set. Previously, when performing these tasks independently, the structure of the data got messed up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script src=&#34;https://gist.github.com/JRatschat/eafe53798b153c617c59c16e4a4ab334.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After conducting the data preparation and the feature engineering tasks, we split train and test set again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After these steps, the structure of the train and test data set is the same. Only the Survived variable is not present in the test set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-&amp;gt;&#34;&gt;&#39;data.frame&#39;: 891 obs. of  13 variables:

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember the overfitting problem that I talked about? To obtain a better model, this problem needs to be prevented while ensuring that the model learns the generalized underlying relationships of the features with the target variable. So we use the train set and split it into a training and a validation set. We use 80% of the passengers for training the model and 20% for the validation of the model. Keep on waiting. I will explain what the validation set does in a few paragraphs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script src=&#34;https://gist.github.com/JRatschat/653426424936cc3d03da607f714fa557.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Afterward, we will create xgb.DMatrices. These are optimized matrices for XGBoost. The label attribute specifies the target variable. We cannot specify a label for the test set since we do not have any information about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script src=&#34;https://gist.github.com/JRatschat/8162866c15fc4762f5929b17c60302c0.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we can train our first XGBoost model. We use the xgboost.train() command, and the gradient booster tree and the objective of binary classification are specified. The maximum number of iterations is set to 1,000. After these settings, the boosting algorithm could be implemented without further specifications on the training set. When keeping the default values, the algorithm would create 1,000 iterations of the model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the problem here? Imagine you are setting the number of iterations to a high number. Then the model iterates forever, and in the end, you would get an accuracy of 100% on your training data. When testing this model on the test set, something strange would happen. “Why do I have only [put any low number here]% accuracy?! I thought my model was perfect!”. True, perfect in the sense that it perfectly describes the underlying data of your training set. Generalizable on other data? No.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To prevent this behavior, we create the validation set that I have talked about. We use the training set to train a model. But instead of training it until eternity, we set the early_stopping_rounds parameter to 50. Setting this parameter is important because it will stop the training of the model when the accuracy of the validation set has not improved for the specified number of rounds. When this is the case, then the algorithm automatically chooses the iteration with the highest accuracy. This setting prevents our overfitting problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the following figure, you can quickly see this behavior. I display accuracy (1-error) and AUC of an XGBoost model depending on the iteration for the training and the validation set. Following my explanations, the training set would quickly reach an accuracy of 96% after 60 rounds. Luckily, our algorithm detects that the validation accuracy is not improving after ten iterations and therefore stops the algorithm at this iteration. Interestingly, the AUC is improving until round 60, so when changing the evaluation metric, we would get another result. Therefore, a change in the evaluation metric can lead to different results. Since we want to optimize the accuracy of the model, we stick to accuracy as an evaluation metric.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;./Accuracy_AUC.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Accuracy and AUC by Iteration of a XGBoost Model. Plot created by author.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, now it’s time to reveal the default XGBoost algorithm. Specifying the watchlist is an important step here because it is the parameter that tells XGBoost to stop iterating when the validation accuracy (1-error) does not improve anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script src=&#34;https://gist.github.com/JRatschat/bf54634575d40158059c039744abb904.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-[1]&#34;&gt;Multiple eval metrics are present. Will use val_error for early stopping.
Will train until val_error hasn&#39;t improved in 50 rounds.

&lt;p&gt;We then predict Survival of the validation set with our model. We display our results with the confusionMatrix command. Ahhhh important information: this is only the result of our validation set! Right now, we want to get a feeling of how good our model COULD be. Please do not confuse it with the test that we will perform afterward with the test set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script src=&#34;https://gist.github.com/JRatschat/95f936add95193619b24b03a21bf176c.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

       &#39;Positive&#39; Class : Survived
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What comes first to my mind is that our first model is especially great in predicting people that died (as seen by the specificity metric). To make a statement about how great our first attempt is, we must assess the balance (in our case imbalance) of the target variable. How many people have survived? How many people died? Quick calculations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-There&#34;&gt;P(prediction=0) = P(class=0) = 0.648
P(prediction=1) = P(class=1) = 0.352
acc = P(class=0) * P(prediction=0) + P(class=1) * P(prediction=1)
    = (0.648 * 0.648) + (0.352 * 0.352)
    = 0.5438
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what we can say is that our model performed 32.77 percentage points (0.8715–0.5438) better than a “weighted guess” (thanks to this post for refreshing my knowledge). But as I said, this is only the result of the validation set which we used to optimize our model. So let’s test our default model by submitting it to Kaggle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After uploading the predictions of the test set to Kaggle, we get our first result. We reached an accuracy of 76.07%. So we lost around 11% compared to the validation accuracy…DAMN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;But maybe there is light at the end of the tunnel?! What if hyperparameter-tuning is the solution?!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;hyperparameter-tuning-of-an-xgboost-model&#34;&gt;Hyperparameter-Tuning of an XGBoost Model&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are different approaches to select hyperparameters. Due to this high degree of choice, many users choose the values of hyperparameters based on reputation, intuitive appeal, or adhere to the default parameter values. This may result in a model whose potential has not been fully utilized [2]. Okay, what have we learned? A structured hyperparameter-tuning process can increase the potential of our model!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I certainly did was to look at these great posts to get a feeling of how I could do it: here and here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some authors used an iterative manual search approach. They selected hyperparameter-values, ran the model, looked at the output, found some logic, and repeated the whole process. Some first optimized the learning rate, other the number of tree leaves, etc. For me, I could not find one clear routine and it is definitely a time-consuming process. Also, it does not seem to follow the definition of tuning since this process is not really systematic and automated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Way more advanced, I found hyperparameter-tuning procedures in the mlr and caret packages that make use of grid and random search procedures. But what are grid and random search? The grid method runs all possible combinations of predefined values for hyperparameters. The higher the number of discrete values for hyperparameters and the more hyperparameters, the more computationally expensive this method. To be specific, grid search creates an exponentially increasing number of models the more values and the more hyperparameters are used. Thus, it gets difficult to handle quite quickly. With random search, one only defines the search space and sets the number of models that have to be created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I had a look into the literature and found a great paper from Bergstra et al. (2012). Their research shows that the random search approach has a higher efficiency compared to grid trials and manual search when granting the same computation time. Also, contradictory to the manual search of hyperparameters, the results acquired through random search are reproducible [3]. NICE!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, I build a random search algorithm with the mlr package, but I faced severe problems. Due to the complex structure of this algorithm, the process had long running times and I could only test around 150 models per hour. Definitely too slow for an algorithm that takes less around 1 second to execute. Sure, k-fold cross-validation sounds really cool and provides more reliable results, but I just was not patient enough. Luckily, we have out-of-bag observations as provided in the test set through which we can evaluate the model performance of the trained algorithm. Also, testing my results became an issue. I could just not say with certainty that I created the algorithm with the right settings. This was due to the fact that I could not compare the results of the algorithm and a simple XGBoost model with the same hyperparameter-values because of k-fold cross-Validation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what did I do? In the end, I just created 10,000 random hyperparameter-value sets within a given search space with a for-loop. Then I executed the XGBoost algorithm 10,000 times with the predefined hyperparameter value sets. Of course, I saved the hyperparameter values and the corresponding validation accuracy as a csv-file. Specifying a seed before the random creation of the hyperparameters and the search algorithm ensured that the results are reproducible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script src=&#34;https://gist.github.com/JRatschat/9ae001ec6d13c2a0e736f617a7fc21d0.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To evaluate my approach, I asked myself the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do I understand my procedure? Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can I explain this approach to my professor or my fellow Kaggle competitors? Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How long did it take to compare 10,000 XGBoost models with differing hyperparameter values? 29.7 minutes with a standard consumer laptop. Is this fast? Yes. Could I increase the speed with parallel computing if I wanted? Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can I state that I have found the best model? No. Although a high number of models are created, it is clear that the described approach has not found the very best model performance. To obtain better results, one could alter the search space or even include more hyperparameters. Still, finding the perfect model could not be stated after additional random searches with changed settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does that procedure lead to the most stable model there is? Most likely not. As I said, using other methods (k-fold cross-validation, stratification, etc.) could lead to a more stable model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in the end, I decided on a procedure that is both fast and easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s have a look at the random search table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script src=&#34;https://gist.github.com/JRatschat/6553616b4edf0a6a950641b99afd1d95.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src=&#34;https://gist.github.com/JRatschat/dc6037f17d3c22d15845f57b2b3436cc.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Values are rounded. If only copied like this into the model, you will obtain different results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, hyperparameter tuning has a strong effect on the performance of the model. The validation accuracy ranges between 80.4 percent and 89.4 percent, with a median of 86.6 percent and a mean of 86.7 percent. Remember, the validation accuracy that we got from an XGBoost model with default values was 87.2 percent…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To see more details, we plug the hyperparameters of the best hyperparameter value set into our XGBoost algorithm and again have a look at the model’s statistics and the confusion matrix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script src=&#34;https://gist.github.com/JRatschat/25126e95491332b31b71fc9aeb64862a.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

       &#39;Positive&#39; Class : Survived
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most significant improvement: sensitivity has increased by 4.77 percentage points. Having better validation results is great, but in the end, only our test accuracy score is essential. Now, the final moment has come…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script src=&#34;https://gist.github.com/JRatschat/9be2d602fcb4877e75cc9205a343c0c4.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We get an accuracy of 77.99%. This is better than the accuracy of our base model. But how have we done against other Kaggler’s? Hmmm…it doesn’t look too good for our model, as we can see in the below plot. We are only under the top 37%. That’s why we come to the final learning of my blog post. Hyperparameter-tuning is the last part of the model creation process. Since I got too excited about my search algorithm, I did not put enough time in feature engineering my model. Without useful features that the model can learn from, I can do all the hyperparameter-tuning I want. It will still be just mediocre. Therefore, when time is limited, one should focus on feature engineering and not on hyperparameter-tuning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;Histogram of the public leaderboard scores. The models that have had better accuracy than our model are displayed in black, the others are displayed in grey. We would have gotten an accuracy of 0.627 if we had predicted that everyone died. An accuracy of 0.766 would have been achieved if we had predicted that all males over the age of three died and that the women and children survived. Plot created by author.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Were all the efforts for nothing? Of course not. If you have enough time, you can create great features and use a hyperparameter-tuning process (in the end!) that helps you to extract the very last accuracy percentage points out of your model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I have introduced here is a procedure that I used to tune the model that I created for a seminar paper. Although plenty of information can be found via Google, I struggled to find a suitable solution for my needs. What I wanted, in the end, was something that I could correctly understand and which did not require endless hours to compute. Also, I wanted an automated approach whose results I could replicate at any point in time. These criteria are definitely fulfilled by my simple random search algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t claim that this procedure leads to the best or the most stable model. If you had the pleasure to stumble upon a better solution, have any questions or comments, feel free to reach me via the contact field or

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;about-the-paper&#34;&gt;About the paper&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research paper was written in summer 2020 within the Master&amp;rsquo;s seminar &lt;em&gt;Data Mining in Marketing: Data Driven Customer Analytics with Machine Learning&lt;/em&gt;. In partial fulfillment of the requirements of the seminar, I predicted and interpreted cross-selling purchase probabilities using XGBoost and SHAP values in R. Read the full paper here: 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/JRatschat/Boosting-Gradient-Boosting-Interpretability/blob/master/Boosting_Gradient_Boosting_Interpretability.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Boosting Gradient Boosting Interpretability: Predicting and Interpreting Cross-Selling Purchase Probabilities of a Large German Savings Bank&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction-and-findings&#34;&gt;Introduction and Findings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper, a dataset from a large German savings bank is used to predict crossselling purchase probabilities and decisions in the customer base. The goals of this paper are (1) to accurately predict whether an already existing customer will open a checking account and (2) to explore which effect the features have on the prediction to enhance the interpretability of the model. To reach these goals, the paper leverages one of the leading gradient boosting algorithms there is, namely XGBoost. It has been used with great success on many machine learning and data mining challenges. Among the advantages of XGBoost are that its models are easily scalable, tend to avoid overfitting, and can be used for a wide range of problems (Chen &amp;amp; Guestrin 2016, p. 785-786). To tackle the lack of easy interpretability of boosted trees (Friedman 2001, p. 1229–1230), this paper implements SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values to explain the output of the XGBoost model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When accuracy is the main goals, then one should use more complex models. Although tuning an XGBoost model is computationally expensive, once it is tuned, it becomes computationally cheap. It becomes apparent that such prediction systems have their place in marketing analytics departments. Instead of only predicting the likelihood of buying a checking account, marketing departments could extend this approach to any product offering to compare purchasing probabilities and target customers with the products for which they have the highest probability to buy. Through this strategy, it could become feasible to target the right customers and to ultimately increase profitability. For this concept to be successful, several additional topics need to be addressed. One has to assess which customers have the potential to be profitable while excluding customers that lead to losses (Shah et al. 2012). Also, one must answer the question when and where a customer should be targeted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, SHAP values enable its users to critically examine complex models and to understand how dependent variables were predicted. Through this method, users gain further knowledge about importance, extent and direction of feature variables on the target variable. Although causal statements cannot be made through this approach, it still helps users to gain trust in the model, to find ways of improving the model, and to get a new understanding of the data. Therefore, this enhanced interpretability should increase user adoption. When only using tools from the xgboost package, this would not be feasible to such an extent. The trust of the analysis through SHAP values is increased because suggested underlying trends of the data have been amongst others discovered by RFM-models (Bauer 1988, Miglautsch 2000). Customers that have recently acquired another product have an higher prediction value than customers that have not bought another product for a longer period of time. Also, the more active customers are (as measured by logins), the higher is the prediction that these customers cross-buy a checking account. Other important trends found in the data are that younger customers exhibit an higher prediction probability than older customers and that checking account ads always lead to a positive effect on the prediction, although with varying extent. This paper shows that giro_mailing does lead to a negative interaction effect on the prediction when appearing with younger or recent customers. This could indicate that the model finds autoresponse within the group of younger or recent customers and punishes this effect with a negative interaction value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;XGBoost models should be used in practice for predicting cross-selling purchase probabilities and decisions. One of the biggest disadvantages - lack of interpretability - can be mitigated through the use of SHAP values that greatly expand the transparency, explainability, interpretability of complex tree-based models.&lt;/p&gt;
