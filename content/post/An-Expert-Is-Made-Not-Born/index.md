I was failing. I had worked my ass off. But somehow, I did not see any success.

It was not that I wasn't reaching anyone. I got meetings with interested potential clients. But after having had numerous pitches, I did not see any results.

I got rejected. Often. I heard all the excuses.

* Sorry, we don't have have any budget right now. Let's talk in half a year.
* I talked with the relevant division. They don't have time to organize something.
* Your proposal sounds interesting. I'll forward you to another part of the company where you'll fit better.

And of course, I never heard back from the company.

At that time, I decided to work harder. To approach more clients. To get more meetings. Somewhere I had heard that hard work would ultimately pay off as a sales guy. Success was waiting for me.

But of course, nothing changed. The system that I had built was running, but not in my favor.

One day I met with one of the founders for lunch. All of a sudden, he said to me, "Jonathan, it's not working, right?". I responded, "I'm doing everything I can, but I don't know what's going on".

>What he then told me was one of the best advice I'd ever been given.

"Jonathan, I can't help you. But I bet there is someone who can help you. Why don't you ask Justin? He is one of the best sales guys I know".

I was on fire. Justin, yeah, I knew this guy. Startup founder. Cool guy, approachable, and lots of experience.

Overly motivated as I was, I not only reached out to him but also his sales head. One thing led to another, and I had two meetings scheduled.

What happened? We talked a lot about my sales process. About every little detail that I had never thought of. After meeting both of them for 30 minutes each, I was able to point out the mistakes I had made. Not just the mistakes, but also the things I was not doing.

What happened then? I still put in the hard work. But this time, everything changed. Instead of zero offers, I had three on the table. Since we only had one spot open, I had to cancel two potential partners.

>When looking back, these mistakes seem so obvious. But little did I know back then.

I had not asked anyone for advice when I started my new role. Everyone seemed to be determined that I was the very best candidate for this role. Therefore, it never crossed my mind to ask for help.

Also, when I was not successful, I did not question my approach. I mean, I was approaching clients and meeting with them. It was just bad luck that I did not get the response that I wanted.

It took someone else to open my eyes. And when my eyes were open, I was able to seek the advice I needed. And when I sought the direction I needed, my actions changed for good.

## This is how I seek advice.

I just ask for it. When I have a problem that Google cannot solve, I think about who I can ask. Do I know anyone who could get me going in the right direction? If not, do I have a friend that knows a lot of people in this particular field?

When I have identified someone that can genuinely help me, I sent a message. Straightforward. Where? Most often, they are acquaintances, so I either have their phone number, or I am connected on LinkedIn with them.

I state my problem. What is important here is that I am specific about my problem. That I cannot solve it by myself. Also, I show respect by asking this particular person for advice. I trust this person to be able to help me.

What I ask for is a phone call. Most often, they are glad to help. I mean, who doesn't like to help someone who is actively seeking one's advice? Someone who shows respect and trust?

I know it takes courage to ask an acquaintance or even a stranger for help. But ultimately, their input can help me to solve problems that I could not have solved by myself.

What I've learned through this experience is that hard work is not always the solution. That I'm not an expert just because my job description says so. Therefore, I am allowed to get advice. And this advice can help me to get to the very next level.
