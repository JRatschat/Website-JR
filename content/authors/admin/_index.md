I am passionate about data because it can uncover hidden structures and enable informed decisions. Hence, I use various econometric or machine learning methods to create analyses that (supposedly) generate fascinating insights.

>I want to share this fascination with others.

Feel free to have a look at my projects and insights that I post here from time to time :rocket:
